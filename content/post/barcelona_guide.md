This is a list of special places to visit that we’ve discovered during our time in Barcelona. I’ve excluded any obvious touristic spots, since you will read about those in every guide book and blog post. I try to keep this as up-to-date as possible, however make sure to double check that the place is still open. Enjoy your trip and drop me a line if you want to meet up!

## Visiting


## Out of the City
If you fancy getting out of the city for a day trip, you can easily do this in Barcelona. There are some excellent beaches if you go to Costa Brava in the north or Costa Dorada in the south. You can take a train from Passeig de Gràcia or Plaça Catalunya depending on your destination (check Google Maps), and be at the beach within an hour. We highly recommend doing this if you have a few days here. All of these destinations are within a 5 minute walking distance of the train station when you arrive.
