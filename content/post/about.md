My name is Taylan Pince, and Kaizen Musings is my little corner of the internet. I tend to use this patch as a way to self-document my various interests, both personal and professional. It’s also a good excuse to write more, which I enjoy as a strategy for thought exploration and personal growth.

## Who Am I?
I am a software engineer turned product manager and entrepreneur. I spent the last 20-odd years launching startups from the idea stage and getting them to market. I also launched and grew [a digital product agency](https://hipolabs.com). I enjoyed the journey and the battle scars that came with it. Most importantly, I got to meet and work with some wonderful people along the way.

I lived in 3 countries so far, and I moved between Europe and North America 4 times. I currently live in sunny Barcelona, Spain with my two daughters and lovely wife. This location appears to be permanent. For now.

## Writing
I am a naturally curious person, and I tend to deep dive into specific topics over different periods of my life. I try to document these immersions and summarize my learnings as best as I can, mostly for my future self.

Recent deep dives include:
- Industrial Revolution and Birth of Factories
- [3D Printing and Robotics](/tags/project-rover)
- [DIY Electronics and Circuit Board Design](/tags/electronics)
- Game Design
- Japanese Culture and Kaizen Philosophy

In addition to these, I regularly write about specific topics:
- [Product Management](/tags/product-management)
- [Games](/tags/games)
- [Travel](/tags/travel)
- [Software Engineering](/tags/software-engineering)

## Speaking & Interviews
I used to be afraid of public speaking. Over a decade ago, I took this fear head on and decided to challenge myself. I still get nervous, but I find it’s a good way to balance out my introvert nature. Here is an incomplete list of my past public appearances:
